Serialized models size is too big to send it to github:
remote: error: File serialized_files/model_heuristic.pkl is 487.61 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
remote: error: File serialized_files/model_NN.pkl is 243.80 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB

Simply running serializer.py will create them.
